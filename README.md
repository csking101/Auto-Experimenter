  - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Learning rate scheduling
  - Model architecture selection
  - Cross-validation
  - Testing
  - Dataset and DataLoader creation

- Modular file structure for organization and scalability.
- Experiment configuration management.
- Integration with popular machine learning libraries and frameworks.
- Extensive logging and reporting capabilities.
- Support for multi-GPU training.

### Advanced Features (Computer Vision)

In addition to core features, the system offers advanced capabilities for computer vision tasks:

- Data augmentation for image datasets.
- Object detection and instance segmentation.
- Semantic segmentation.
- Video processing and real-time image analysis.
- Model interpretability and explainability.
- Hardware acceleration and model compression.
- Automated data annotation tools.
- Ethical AI and bias mitigation.
- Multi-language support for broader user accessibility.

### Additional Features (General)

- Support for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- Time series analysis and forecasting capabilities.
- Reinforcement learning support for sequential decision-making.
- Automated data labeling and annotation tools.
- Customizable data preprocessing pipelines.
- Data versioning and management for collaboration.
- Real-time model monitoring and concept drift detection.
- Privacy-preserving machine learning techniques.
- Custom visualization tools for model insights.
- Benchmarking and model selection utilities.
- Integration with external APIs and services.

## File Structure

The project follows a structured directory layout for better organization and modularity:

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files, and data preprocessing scripts.
- **models/**: Stores custom model architectures and main model definitions.
- **experiments/**: Manages experiment configurations, logs, and the main pipeline script.
- **hyperparameter_tuning/**: Implements hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
- **cross_validation/**: Contains cross-validation scripts for model evaluation.
- **testing/**: Includes scripts for model testing and evaluation.
- **utils/**: Stores utility functions and modules shared across components.
- (Additional directories for advanced and optional features are included as needed.)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Configure your experiment settings and hyperparameter ranges in `experiments/config/`.
4. Run the main pipeline script in `experiments/main.py` to start an automated experiment.

## Usage

Detailed documentation and usage instructions for each component and advanced feature can be found in the respective directories. Refer to the README files within those directories for more information.
